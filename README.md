This project is simply to see how to connect to quickbooks desktop and
quickbase using python.

I signed up for a free copy of both softwares. But it sounds like Quickbase
has a free builder account where it is non-production ready but you can just
build things inside of the application.

Quickbase I found the table_id in the URL

My insert statement is not working. I may need to play around with this.

I worked on this project from 12/07/2020-12/11/2020
